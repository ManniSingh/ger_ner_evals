# Evaluation of German Named Entity Recognition Tools

*The following tools combine named entity recognition and named
entity classification. Evaluation metric
is f1-score.*

## Motivation and Goals

There are plenty of named entity recognition (NER) tools for English Corpora. In contrast, there are just a few tools for German NER.
NER for German is much more challenging than NER for English. 
As all proper nouns are capitalized, this
feature is far less effective in comparison to English NER (Faruqui/Pado 2010).

To get an overview of the current state of research the goals of this project are the following:
- research available NER projects,
- collect published evaluation scores of these NER projects (if available),
- which German NER corpora are available freely?
- choose most promising tools and train them on alternative corpora,
- evaluate the tools on an out-of-domain corpus.

Out of scope of this project is to examine the exact methods of these NER tools. 
We just distinguish between two main methods to extract named entities:
1. ML (mainly LSTM *(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory">Long short-term memory</a>)*, CRF *(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_random_field">Conditional Random Field</a>)*, SVM *(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">Support Vector Machines</a>)*)
2. Named Entity Linking (NEL) via Wikidata, DBpedia a.o.

NEL tools are mainly focusing on multilingual NER. These tools use a standard nif format for data input and output, which makes it challenging to compare them
with non NEL tools for NER. There are currently no out-of-the-box solutions to convert the nif format to a common format like CoNLL 2003.
Rather alot of hand-crafted adaption is needed to get proper and comparable output files during evaluation.
Due to this immense extra effort, this project will primarily focus on the non-NEL tools during training and evaluation.
Felix Sasaki mentioned in this context, that 

*"tooling for machine translation training or for training of statistical
named entity recognition currently is far more efficient relying on non-linked data
representations"*

As an exception we include the Freme NER tool into our project, because it is freely available and easy to use. In addition we can show, how awkward it is, to handle the different formats of the NEL world and the non-NEL world.

## Tools:

For building our evaluation pipeline, we use the following tools:

- Python3
- rdflib

Python3 has a comfortable handling of encodings and the rdflib helps us, to read the
nif format, which is the output of the Freme NER tool.
To improve our evaluation workflow we further developed some custom classes and functions:

- evaluate.py (to evaluate NER output data with a gold standard and get f1-score)
- germaner.py (wrapper for java tool, tag a tokenized (one token per line) using the GermaNER tool)
- stanfordner.py (wrapper for java tool, tag a tokenized (one token per line) using the Stanford NER tool)
- spacyner.py (training and tagging for the spaCy tool)
- convert_conll2spacy.py (convert conll input to spaCy data)
- convert_germaeval2spacy.py (convert the germaeval input to spaCy data)
- convert_nif_2_conll.py (convert the Freme NER output nif file to a CoNLL 2003 style tab separated file. Pipeline is still buggy, alot of manual work still to be done, as special characters are sometimes not handled properly)
- lstmner.py just a note, that lstm uses no api, but is a command line tool

## Data 
### Corpora

If we focus on the supervised learning task of NER, there are currently two data sets available:

1. CoNLL 2003 (Tjong Kim Sang/De Meulder 2003)
2. NoSta-D NE - GermEval 2014 (Bernikova 2014)

The GermEval 2014 data set is IOB formated and contains derivation and part classes. These specific classes are striped to the main class, e.g. PERdetriv becomes PER.
For the sake of simplicity and to keep comparability between the CoNLL 2003 and the GermEval 2014 tools, we do not pay attention to the embedded/nested NE, considered in the last column of the GermEval 2014 data set.

All investigated tools had been trained on one of the above and evaluated on either the associated development or test set.
Only the Stanford NER (Faruqui/Pado 2010) had been evaluated on a manually annotated out-of-domain corpora. The corpora contains the first two sessions of the european parliament.
The first session is used for this project, as an independent evaluation data set for all tools, as well. It is not in IOB format.
For the Freme NER tool, we convert the nif output to the common tab separated CoNLL style format using our converter and manually adaptions.

### Formats and NE Classes

The Stanford NER and the LSTM use the NE classes defined in the CoNLL 2003 shared task.
GermaNER uses the same classes, just the MISC class is replaced to OTH. 
This makes all in all four jointly used classes (MISC/OTH, PER, LOC, ORG)
GermaNER and the Stanford NER tool use the IOB format (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Outside_Beginning">link</a>)
Just the LSTM NER tool by default uses an advanced IOB format, the IOBES. Here single (S) named entities and the last token (E) of a named entity are separately recognized . For the sake of somplicity we trained this tool with the simpler IOB format.
The Freme NER tool uses neither IOB nor IOBES.

Freme NER uses a normal text file as an input and returns a turtle nif file as output.
As Freme uses a custom tokenizer, which makes it very challenging, to align the output to our test corpora.
Alternatively Freme accepts turtle as input, but conversion finally had been more efficient via plain text input.
After feeding the Freme tool with the EUROPARL corpus we converted the output into CoNLL style format.
Due to the much larger test corpora from CoNLL and GermEval, we do not test them with Freme.

The german model of spaCy uses a subset of the named entities defined in the OntoNotes 5 corpus (OntoNotes Release 5.0 2012).
To fit the tool with the named entity classes used by Stanford, LSTM, GermaNER and Freme, we trained a new model, based on our four named entity classes.


## Experiments and Evaluation:

For our evaluations, we had to choose tools from all available German NER tools (see appendix).
Our tools need to fulfill the following requirements:

- freely available and open source
- well documentated
- installation is not too complicated and training new models possible in reasonable time (*still problems with GermaNER*).
- if tool is not easy to train, tool needs to offer a German model with our NE classes (MISC/OTH, PER, LOC, ORG) out of the box. 

Majority of the demands are met by the following tools:

- LSTM (Lample 2016)
- GermaNER (Benikova 2015) (problems during training)
- Standford NER (Faruqui, Pad√≥ 2010)
- SpaCy Entity recognition (no specific publication, see https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/491)
- Freme NER (Dojchinovski 2017) (no training possible)

As mentioned in the motivation, we include Freme to show the effort of including NEL tools into a non-NEL evaluation.
LSTM reaches the best scores of all multilingual NER tool and is freely available. Stanford NER and GermaNER are best performing of monolingual NER tools and are freely available, too.
SpaCy is a popular non-academic python NLP tool, comparing itself with Stanford NLP and NLTK.

For the non-NEL tools we first converted the EUROPARL text into a two column tab seperated version. Firtst column contains the token, the second one contains the NE class. The NE classes are represented in non-IOB format.

To train the CoNLL tool Stanford NER with the GermEval 2014 data set, we just used the fourth column of the training data, ignoring the embedded NEs.
For tagging we preprocessed the data, by converting the input data into a list, marking sentence ends by the string 'SENDEND'. The tagger outputs a list of tuples. This list is reformated into our standard two column tab seperated files.
In postprocessing we removed the 'SENTEND' strings and fixed some special character bugs during tagging.

For the tagging process of the GermeNER tool we preprocessed the CoNLL and the europarl data sets to a two column tab seperated version. The first column contained the token, the second the NE class.
The output we used directly in our evaluation class.
Training with GermaNER did not work properly.

For training the LSTM we converted the GermEval data into a column style tab seperated file. The first column contains the tokens, the fifth column the NE classes.
The CoNLL data could be used out of the box.
For testing the LSTM we preprocessed the CoNLL and GermEval data, by converting them into a file containing one sentence per line.
The tagged output is by default in a special tokenized format. 
*token__NE-class*
This we converted into a our evaluator ready two column tab seperated format.

For the spaCy tool we had to convert the CoNLL and the GermEval data set to the spaCy specific data format (see: https://spacy.io/docs/usage/entity-recognition). 
In addition we had to convert the spaCy output to our evaluation two column tab seperated format.

As there are considerable differences in the used metrics between the CoNLL 2003 and the GermEval 2014 shared tasks, we evaluated the tools on our own, to receive comparable results.
We use the following metrics for evaluation:
- test and gold data  uses four classes (MISC, PER, LOC, ORG),
- we use a strict evaluation metric, True Positive we just reach, if both tokens are classified exactly the same way, e.g. gold and system annotation marks a token as PER


1. For the LSTM NER tool we train a model on CoNLL 2003. In addition we trained a model using the GermEval 2014 data set.
Both models had been evaluated on the CoNLL, GermEval and EUROPARL data set.

        - tested on: CoNLL-2003 testa (62.8%), GermaEval (75.8%), EUROPARL (61.8%)
        
2. For the GermaNER we use the pre-trained model, trained on the GermEval 2014 data set. In addition we trained our own model using the 
CoNLL 2003 data set. Both models we evaluated on the CoNLL testa set, GermEval test set and EUROPARL data set. 

    **GermaNER**
    - pretrained on: GermEval 2014

    - trained on: CoNLL-2003 (self-trained, *still training*)
        - tested on: CoNLL-2003 testa (X), GermaEval (X), EUROPARL (X)

3. For the Stanford NER we used the pre-trained model on the CoNLL 2003 data set, using the current version of Stanford NER v. 3.7.0. In addition we trained our own model in the GermEval 2014 data set. 
Both models we evaluated on the CoNLL, GermEval and EUROPARL data set.

    **Stanford NER**
    - pretrained on: CoNLL-2003
        - tested on: CoNLL-2003 testa (**81.1%**), GermaEval (60.1%), EUROPARL (**71.9%**)
    - trained on: GermEval 2014 (self-trained)
        - tested on: CoNLL-2003 testa (61.3%), GermaEval (75.8%), EUROPARL (60.0%)
        
3. For the spaCy Entity recognition tool we trained a model on the CoNLL 2003 data set. In addition we trained a model on the GermEval 2014 data set. 
Both models we evaluated on the CoNLL, GermEval and EUROPARL data set.

    **spaCy Entity recognition**

        - tested on: CoNLL-2003 testa (64.1%), GermaEval (71.8%), EUROPARL (64.6%)

5. As for the last tool, we did not create our own trained model for the Freme NER. This is due to the lack of documentation about training a model.
    
    **Freme NER**
    - pretrained on: 1. DBPedia, 2. via CRF based on Stanford, Data set not clear
        - tested on: EUROPARL (66.5%)
    
## Synopsis

Our evaluationis show, taht NER for German is still a challenging task. 
We collected ten different NER system for German, having a monolinguistic approach.
These tools use different learning algorithms, though conditional random fields (CRF) are by far the most common and reach the best scores.
As for the multilingual approach, we collected six different NER tools. 
As we have seen for the monolingual tools, CRF reaches the best results here, too. 
Though the tool with the highest score combines CRF with neural networks.

We chose the best performing tools, which are freely available and reach the best f1-scores.
All other tools are either not freely available or are based on rather uncommon platforms, e.g. the haskell platform. This makes
it difficult to set them up (the Sequor).

The 'gold standard' of german NER tools was and still is the Stanford NER tool (Faruqui/Pado 2010).
Similar results we get from GermaNER (Benikova 2015), a tool which is based totally on open source and freely available resources.
But as well the LSTM tool (Lample 2016) is a promising approach for german NER.
Though there had been several publications on this topic in this decade, in the official published results all tools stay beneath an f1-score of 80%.
An exception is the current Stanford NER tool, which improved its f1-score on the CoNLL training/test pair in our experiments to 81.1%.

The Stanford NER as well reached the best out-of-domain result on the EUROPARL test corpus with an f1-score of 71.92%.

NEL approaches, such as the Freme NER tool try to bypass the lack of freely available NE corpora by using huge linked data resources as wikidata or dbpedia.
Still they cannot outperform our best evaluated NER tools.

## Future Work

Another challenging tasks for NER are medical texts. Unstructured and small data sets make 
training very hard. Thats why the evaluations on an out-of-domain data set had been a main goal of
this project. Using this knowledge, could be helpful for NER for medical texts.
Thats why a future task would be to
- (train and) test the tools on medical texts,
- investigate current research projects on NER for medical texts.

To better combine the NEL and non-NEL research, it would be desirable to develop
- generic converting tools to convert nif to CoNLL style.
- extend current DEL tools, to accept pre tokenized text for training.
